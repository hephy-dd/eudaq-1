# Elog Producer

GUI implemented as a producer.
The Elog program https://elog.psi.ch/elog/ is used to report entries to an Elog server.
Logs can be submitted manually as well as automatically on end of a run.

The ini and config options can be seen in the template files in the misc folder.

* In the ini file the setup of the elog program (server, available attributes,...) is defined.
* In the config file there are options to gather config files from external frameworks and to attach them to the automatic log entries.
